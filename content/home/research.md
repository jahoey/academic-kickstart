### Estimating genetic diversity and effective population size of an overfished species

The demographic history of a population is important for conservation and evolution, but it is unknown for many populations. We are using SNP genotypes from archived collections of larval summer flounder (*Paralichthys dentatus*, n = 285) from three cohorts to examine how contemporary effective population size and genetic diversity responded to changes in fishing intensity over time.

### Quantifying performance curves across a thermal gradient

I am working with collaborators at the NOAA Sandy Hook Labratory in New Jersey to test for divergent thermal tolerance phenotypes in summer flounder larvae from either end of the species range, building from the genomic evidence of divergent selection that I previously found. We are quantifying the thermal performance curve of summer flounder by rearing eggs and larvae across a 20ÂºC thermal gradient.
