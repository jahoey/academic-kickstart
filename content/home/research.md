### Estimating genetic diversity and effective population size of an overfished species

The demographic history of a population is important for conservation and evolution, but it is unknown for many populations. Methods that use genomic data have been developed to infer demographic parameters, but they can be challenging to implement and interpret, particularly for large populations. Thus, understanding if and when genetic estimates of demography correspond to true population history is important for assessing the performance of these genetic methods. Here, we used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing data from archived collections of larval summer flounder (*Paralichthys dentatus*, n = 285) from three cohorts to examine how contemporary effective population size and genetic diversity responded to changes in fishing intensity in a natural population. Despite little to no detectable change in genetic diversity, coalescent-based demographic modeling from site frequency spectra revealed that summer flounder population size declined dramatically. The timing and direction of change corresponded to the observed decline in spawning stock biomass from independent surveys of fish abundance. Despite subsequent increases in census abundance, we could not determine whether effective population size also increased over time. Our results demonstrate that genetic sampling can be useful for detecting population trends, even in species with large effective sizes.

### Quantifying performance curves across a thermal gradient

![rainbow_fish.jpg](/static/img/rainbow_fish.jpg =100x70)

I am working with collaborators at the NOAA Sandy Hook Labratory in New Jersey to test for divergent thermal tolerance phenotypes in summer flounder larvae from either end of the species range, building from the genomic evidence of divergent selection that I previously found. We are quantifying the thermal performance curve of summer flounder by rearing eggs and larvae across a 20ÂºC thermal gradient.
